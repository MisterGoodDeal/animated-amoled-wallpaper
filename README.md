## 📝 Edit and export your own wallpaper

In order to customize your own wallpaper, you have to open the `Fond ecran anime.eap` file in at least After Effect `22.1.1`.

Then in the `Project` panel you have to right-click on the `Template` composition and click on `Composition settings...`. Now set the desired witdh and height of your device and click `OK`.

Now double-click on the `Template` composition and left-click on `Adjustement Layer 1`. The effect tab should open on the top-left corner of your screen. If not, go to `Window\Effects: Adjustement Layer 1` and click it. Now the panel should show up.

Now you should be able to change the color of the waves and the background with the `Tint` effect. If you want to change the black background, just click on the first color picker and select the color you want. If you want to change the waves color, just hit the second color picker and change it.

Now you're ready to export !
